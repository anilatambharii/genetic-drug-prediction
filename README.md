Personalized drug response prediction using genetic markers and machine learning.

# Personalized Drug Response Prediction System

This repository contains a simplified example of a system for predicting an individual's response to a specific drug based on their genetic profile. This project demonstrates a basic machine learning approach using genetic markers (SNPs) to predict drug response (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Overview

This project aims to illustrate the concept of personalized medicine by leveraging genetic information.  It uses a machine learning model to predict how a patient might respond to a particular drug, potentially minimizing adverse reactions. This is a simplified example for educational purposes and should not be used for actual medical decisions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- Flask
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a spreadsheet program (e.g., Excel, LibreOffice Calc)

## Data

- **Batch Data (`genetic_data.xlsx` or database table):** Contains historical patient records (de-identified) with genetic markers (SNPs) and observed drug responses.  A sample Excel file is included for demonstration.  *In a real-world application, this data would come from a secure database.*
- **Real-time Data:** Genetic data from new patients, received via API.  The API expects data in JSON format.

## System Architecture

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Batch data is loaded from the database/spreadsheet, and real-time data is received via the API.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Relevant genetic markers are extracted.
3.  **ML Model:** A classification model (Random Forest in this example) is trained to predict drug response.
4.  **Prediction Service:** The trained model is exposed via a Flask API for real-time predictions.
5.  **Reporting (Not Implemented):**  In a real application, this component would generate reports for medical professionals.

## ML Architecture

- **Model Type:** Random Forest (for simplicity and interpretability).
- **Training Data:** Batch patient data.
- **Input Features:** Selected SNPs (e.g., SNP1, SNP2, SNP3).
- **Output:** Predicted drug response (positive, negative, neutral).

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/[repo-name].git` (Replace with your repo name)
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd [repo-name]`
3.  Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Create a `requirements.txt` file with the library names)
4.  Set up your database or create the `genetic_data.xlsx` file.

## Usage

1.  Run the Flask API: `python app.py`
2.  Send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the real-time genetic data in JSON format:

```json
{"SNP1": "AG", "SNP2": "TC", "SNP3": "CG"}
